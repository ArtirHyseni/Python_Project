Project:
We are wanting to create a pacman replica game. We picked pacman because it will allow us to explore a variety of elements that we all want to gain experience with by the end of this project. These elements are: AI, Working with Threads, Graphical User Interface, Multiple Users (potentially through networks), record of scores/scoring, different game modes and different levels.
