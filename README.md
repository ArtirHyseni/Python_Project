Project:
We are wanting to create a pacman replica game. We picked pacman because it will allow us to explore a variety of elements that we all want to gain experience with by the end of this project. These elements are: Functional player controls, fully generated 2D-drawn board, functional AI, graphical user interface, record of scores/scoring, and custom created levels. 

DIRECTIONS:
Player controlling requires using the keyboard. Using the arrow keys; up, down, left and right will guide Pac-Man through the maze. Collect the dots and avoid the ghosts to complete each level and obtain a highscore. When the player loses all their lives, the game ends and the player is brought back to the beginning of the game.
